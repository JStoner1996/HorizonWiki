        <h1>Horizon: Zero Dawn</h1>
        <p>
          <b><i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i></b
          >&copy; is a 2017 action role-playing game developed by Guerrilla
          Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game was
          released for PlayStation 4 in 2017 and Windows in 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i> is the first game of the Horizon video game
          series. The plot follows Aloy, a young hunter in a world overrun by
          machines, who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged
          weapons, a spear, and stealth to combat mechanical creatures and other
          enemy forces. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and
          bonuses. The player can explore the open world to discover locations
          and take on side quests.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i> is Guerrilla Games' first intellectual
          property since Killzone in 2004 and its first role-playing video game.
          Development began in 2011 after the completion of Killzone 3, with
          director Mathijs de Jonge considering it the riskiest idea pitched at
          the time. The game engine, Decima, was developed for Killzone: Shadow
          Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Being set in a
          post-apocalyptic setting, anthropologists were consulted to
          authenticate the world's decay over a millennium. The soundtrack was
          led by composer Joris de Man, featuring contributions from The Flight.

          The <span class="machine">Thunderjaw</span
          ><sup><a href="Machines/Thunderjaw.html">[1]</a></sup>
          is a favourite machine among many players. Resembling a T-Rex, this
          large machine can be devastating. Hosting two large cannons on it's
          legs, it can quickly decimate any foe.
